### Movie DB API Key is required.

In order for the app to function properly, an API key for themoviedb.org must be included with the build.

[Generate an API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup), and include the key for the build by adding the following line to [USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties

`MovieDbApiKey="<UNIQUE_API_KEY">`
